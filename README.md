This started out as my attempt to complete Challenge 21 from the Advent. The challenge was to implement "add" and "delete" functionality to a simple budget app. The app should also keep track of the balance, and totals. Here, and in other recent projects, I specifically avoided the use of React.

I initially accomplished both asks, then started building onto the app. One of these added features was the ability to edit an expense. Eventually however I re-wrote the code from the ground up. I also moved away from the SVGs and instead used Google's Material Symbols.

I have wanted to build an app like this for awhile. For years. I already added categories, and, eventually I want to implement chart.js to visualize the data.
